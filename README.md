# <Unit 2 Challenge: Portfolio>

## Description

Tasks:
To create an online portfolio with a profile or avatar
Add navigation and make the navigation responsive, when initiated it will add breakpoints and travel to the selected part of the webpage.
Include name and contact details.
Add interactivity to the images (e.g. change opacity when hovered)
Apply a flex box to the page

#criteria
    When the page is loaded the page presents your name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about you, your work, and how to contact you
    When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
    When viewing the section about your work then the section contains titled images of your applications
    When presented with the your first application then that application's image should be larger in size than the others
    When images of the applications are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed application
    When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport

## Future Improvements

I learned how to use the flex box model and apply containers, I created a navigation bar at the top and added links to the headings for each section. I included a hover effect that change the opacity. The web page does not look very aesthetically pleasing but I believe that I have attempted all of the criteria in the challenge and given more time I would practice using the flex box model and try to understand how to use media query to improve the aesthetics when viewed using different devices.

I would also take more time to neaten up the HTML code and use more descriptive naming conventions and add alt text to the images.

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Credits](#credits)
- [License](#license)

## Installation

My code does not currently need an install and can be viewed directly through the URL.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:
